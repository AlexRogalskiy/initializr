<!--
Thanks for taking the time to draft up an issue for the Axon Initializr!
Before starting, please read the following:

## Usage Questions

If you are having difficulty using the Axon Initializr,
 please consider checking Axon's Reference Guide first if it answers your question: https://docs.axoniq.io.
 
When the Reference Guide does no cover the specific question you have, take the following into account:
- GitHub is *not* intended for usages questions, instead:
- Drop a question on AxonIQ's forum: https://discuss.axoniq.io/
- Or place a new question on StackOverflow, using the `axon` tag.

## Reporting a bug, feature, or enhancement

Before filing an issue, please verify that it's not already reported by someone else.
After you've done that, your ticket will typically fall under one of the following options:

1. It's a `bug`,
2. It's a `feature` request, or
3. It's an `enhancement` request.

We recommend that for either of the three, you use one of the prepared issue templates.
You can find all three of them [here](https://github.com/AxonIQ/initializr/issues/new/choose). 

## None of the above fit!

If you have encountered a use case that is not a question or a feature request, please draft your scenario below.
